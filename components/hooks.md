# Lifecycle hooks

These are functions you can add to your component to hook into different parts of the rendering process. You can use these to manipulate the DOM in some way or trigger an action to change state.

```js
export default function MyComponent (model) {
  return <div>{model.attributes.text}</div>
}

export function onCreate (model, context) {
  console.log('A MyComponent entity was created!')
}
```
